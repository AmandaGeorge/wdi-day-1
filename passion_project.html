	What if I made a site where people could sign up and request annonymous feedback about themselves?
	<br>
	- Positive feedback could be public based on user preference.
	<br>
	- Negative/constructive feedback would always be private.
	<br>
	- People would sign up in order to give feedback, but opening themselves up to feedback would be optional.
	<br>
	- Anyone who posts negative feedback to the positive/public section would be banned from the site.
	<br>
	- Feedback giver would have to check boxes confirming their feedback matches the criteria of positive/constructive feedback and acknowledge that posting negative things to the positive/public section will get them banned before they can complete their post.
